## Introduction
Welcome to our music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This player features a play/pause button, progress bar and song information display, making it easy to control and keep track of the current song. Additionally, we've added functionality such as a queue, seek forward, and seek backward, allowing you to easily navigate through your music. We've also included the thumbnail of the song to give you a visual representation of what you're listening to. The UI has been designed with CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. We hope you enjoy using our music player!
